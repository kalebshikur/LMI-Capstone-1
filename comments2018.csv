0002,"under the current standards for medicare shared savings program (mssp) upside-only models, organizations are not forced to make a commitment to a new business model centered on value and outcomes, rather than on volume and market power. the length of time allowed in a one-sided risk model has historically proven to show no benefits to reduction of costs. this new process outlined in the ""pathways to success"" has great potential to change the landscape of accountable care organizations (aco) and cost reduction. however, by constantly lowering the benchmark for those that meet them can inevitably create a benchmark that is quite virtually unattainable. the health of individuals, especially older individuals that utilize healthcare resources is dynamic; in that it is constantly changing. these individuals may require more resources at certain times, virtually diminishing the cost savings an organization can see. perhaps a change in thinking with regards to the percentage of change for benchmarks based on savings should be reconsidered. this could make the two-sided risk models more enticing and feasible to organizations. a greater technical and policy alignment of the aco program with medicare advantage could encourage enrollment and benefit providers and patients alike, by adding predictability and reducing complexity. according to mostashari and broome (2018) the processes for establishing these rates are well understood, and the rates themselves are much more predictable. the rates are set prospectively, and do not require extensive analysis of cost trends months after the conclusion of the performance years.

i can make this very long and detailed with references and evidence to support claims. but at the same time i want to make this succinct and to the point. i, as a provider and administrator of a health system, have had a chance to review the proposed rule and feel it it my duty to respond with constructive comments.

i feel the cms philosophy on accountable care organization and pathway to risk is fundamentally flawed. the uncertainty of targets, statistical chances or variation and volume based rewards continue in this pathway. i would like to strongly urge you all to consider overhauling the entire program. your proposal does nothing but extends the program for another five years. meanwhile you will continue to pay out large sums of monies based on random variations, wrongful rewards, and statistical ""winners.""

here are the suggestions i have from a provider and management perspective who has dealt with moving a financially troubled organization towards value based care:

1. your benchmark target setting strategy is unnecessarily complex, allows for propagation of ""bad"" utilization behavior, and rewards for minor adjustments. if you are truly looking to bend the cost curve, then regressing to mean national benchmark is absolutely important. elimination of regional variation is critical. rewarding the 50% of aco's that fall below the national pbpy spend is sending the message that cost of care is critical to success in aco. higher cost aco's do not contribute to reduced cost, and should face a penalty. so, set a national base benchmark that would be risk adjusted based on regional variations of risk score and only risk score. this creates absolute transparency in the benchmarks and goals.

2. pay back penalties are ridiculous and will cause a many aco's to drop out of the program. it is interesting that you have not set up a pay back system for the physicians and providers. under mips the providers face a penalty, but for aco structure you have imposed a pay back strategy. i would recommend you consider a pathway for penalty. instead of pay back, aco's whose spend is greater than the set target will achieve a negative adjustment proportional to the percentage overspent from the benchmark for both part a and part b payments. to ease the burden, you could lift and divide the effect by half to make it equal to shared savings. you will likely get more aco's taking risk on this pathway than the current proposed payback methodology.

3. the proposed rules continue to make misalignment between physician payments and aco's financial responsibilities. on one hand, you expect the aco's to bring physicians together and improve cost and quality of care. on the other hand, you set up different financial consequences for aco's and providers. the aco takes financial risk, but the providers are all rewarded with 5% bonus. this is the same effect of enforcing drg based payment to the hospitals, but physician reimbursement continues at ffs. you will get no traction in improving health care delivery by creating such antagonism, which i am sure you have learned from the hospital payment system program. i would recommend you consider the opportunity to reward physicians only if their aco is able to beat the benchmark. the aapm adjustment would only apply if the aco generated shared savings or demonstrated financial responsibility.

4. the retrospective quality payment is ineffective as a strategy. it will never lead to quality improvement since the timelines do not match with realistic and practical patient outcomes. since medicine changes so rapidly, cms needs to embrace advancement in quality outcomes more than process based measures. the undue burden of reporting and administrative tasks is only creating provider burnout, not improving quality. to be effective, i would recommend stream lining quality efforts to 10 specific outcome measures that lead to social and public health impact. having direct financial incentive for each one and not tied with other financial outcomes allows organizations and physicians to drive, fund, and sustain continued quality efforts. you can financially justify additional payments with the move towards national benchmark target.

5. finally, the concept of risk should include advancement to complete risk, not just shared risk. i would recommend that if an aco with sufficient volume is able to demonstrate good quality and low cost for three consecutive years, then they should be advanced for a more comprehensive capitated partnership. allow them to take on complete risk with capitated payments and complete scope of services for the care of the patient. this will lift burden from cms. cms can continue to provide oversight, monitor claims activity and adjust capitation rates based on services provided and overall quality of care delivered.

please do not hesitate to reach out if i can help in elaborating any concepts.

0004,"the timeline for the program is impractical and may create undue administrative burden.

1. for aco's that move from lower risk to advance apm, the mips requirement may confuse providers based on annual reporting requirements for 2019. would they report at regular aco mips level, and then be consider qp for the second half of the year? how would they meet their percentage thresholds to become qp especially when these thresholds may be proposed to change next year?

2. for current track 1+ aco's who have taken on initial risk, cms will not have performance data available for them until september 2019. how can they make the decision to advance to enhanced track without knowing their performance final results? i feel the same issue and concern will be faced by all performance-experienced aco's currently as they will not have any feedback on their performance until after the start of the new model.

for these reasons, we would advise cms to consider implementing the new pathways starting january 1, 2020.

as president of the hackensack alliance aco, a track 1 mssp participant from the onset of the program, i would like to share my views on the direction cms is taking as well as the proposed new rules. it is my understanding that the goal of the mssp program was to bend the cost curve and introduce the concept of the triple aim (which became the quadruple aim). a secondary benefit was to develop provider understanding of value based care models. it was clear to many of us that the major components of cost were related to inpatient hospitalizations, and also subacute care programs. interestingly, the historic development of these cost centers stems from governmental regulation creating payment methods for the care. if you pay someone to provide a service, then the service will be provided. if you pay someone for a certain outcome, then effort will be made to ensure that outcome.
the mssp program made no effort to curb the payments to these two major cost centers, and focused on physician behavior to drive success. once again, success was not identified as outcome improvement, but only cost cutting and documentation of process (quality outcomes). the reason acos with strong hospital ties were not as successful as expected is because the hospitals had no reason to change their operating behaviors. in fact, many hospitals were willing to accept readmission penalties, because the payment was in excess of the penalty. therefore, the mssp program rules did not correspond to effectuate the stated goals of the program.
at the same time, other programs were being offered which diluted the ability of acos to succeed. these include medicare advantage and cpc+. the opportunities to realize profit from ma programs encourages hospitals and networks to develop programs specifically for those patients. their leakage is controlled by benefit plan, and the benchmarks are predetermined. in addition, the benchmarks are uniformly higher than mssp. the cpc+ program provides dollars to practices in order to improve care management services. if these services were available in mssp, the results would have been much different. if a physician is participating in mssp and cpc+, then the dollars for care management are added to the cost of care in mssp. this encourages acos to exclude doctors in cpc+, probably their most advanced providers.
the new proposal will decrease the shared savings percentage during the non-risk years. this will lessen the interest in the program. most physician-only acos are fearful of assuming risk because of the inability to control the two largest cost centers, as well as no control over leakage. the hospital supported acos will recognize that the more hospitalizations that occur, the higher risk of losses, and therefore not support mssp.
the point is that it appears that the new proposal intends to allow mssp to die a slow death, and blame the acos for not participating. i urge cms to reevaluate the program by looking at the intended goals, and then building a program which supports attaining those goals. perhaps the goal should be medicare advantage and cpc+ only. perhaps the goal should be to change the medicare benefit plan. perhaps there should be more incentive for medicare recipients to join ma. if the goal is to maintain current medicare enrollment, then the rules must be changed to direct patients away from the two highest cost centers- not just by changing provider behavior, but by changing behavior of hospitals and subacute care centers. as long as these cost centers benefit by volume, the cost curve is safe from bending.
